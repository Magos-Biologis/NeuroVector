For a certain range of conductances, the model generates chaotic action potentials, and the intracellular calcium concentration also varies chaotically. The chaos was characterized by constructing phase portraits and one-variable maps using the membrane potentials and calcium concentrations. This is the first, simple, biophysically realistic model for excitable cells that shows endogenous chaos.},

  abstract     = {Reliable activation of inhibitory pathways is essential for maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition during cortical activity. Little is known, however, about the activation of these pathways at the level of the local neocortical microcircuit. We report a disynaptic inhibitory pathway among neocortical pyramidal cells (PCs). Inhibitory responses were evoked in layer 5~{PC}s following stimulation of individual neighboring PCs with trains of action potentials. The probability for inhibition between. PCs was more than twice that of direct excitation, and inhibitory responses increased as a function of rate and duration of presynaptic discharge. Simultaneous somatic and dendritic recordings indicated that inhibition originated from PC apical and tuft dendrites. Multineuron whole-cell recordings from PCs and interneurons combined with morphological reconstructions revealed the mediating interneurons as Martinotti cells. Martinotti cells received facilitating synapses from PCs and formed reliable inhibitory synapses onto dendrites of neighboring PCs. We describe this feedback pathway and propose it as a central mechanism for regulation of cortical activity. \textcopyright 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {The neuronal plasma membrane delimits the whole neuron, cell body, dendrites, dendritic spines, axon and axon terminals. It is a barrier between the intracellular and extracellular environments. The general structure of the neuronal plasma membrane is similar to that of other plasma membranes. It is made up of proteins inserted in a lipid bilayer, forming as a whole a 'fluid mosaic'. However, insofar as there are functions that are exclusively neuronal, the neuronal membrane differs from other plasma membranes by the nature, density and spatial distribution of the proteins of which it is composed. The presence of a large diversity of transmembrane proteins called ionic channels (or simply 'channels') characterizes the neuronal plasma membrane. They allow the passive movement of ions across membranes and thus electrical signaling in the nervous system.},

  abstract     = {The ionic basis for nerve excitation was first elucidated in the squid giant axon by Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) using the voltage clamp technique. They made the key observation that two separate voltage-dependent currents underlie the action potential: an early transient inward Na<sup>+</sup> current which depolarizes the membrane, and a delayed outward K<sup>+</sup> current largely responsible for repolarization. This led to a series of experiments that resulted in a quantitative description of impulse generation and propagation in the squid axon. Nearly 30 years later, Sakmann and Neher, using the patch clamp technique, recorded the activity of the voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels responsible for action potential initiation and propagation. Taking history backwards, action potentials will be explained from the single channel level to the membrane level.},

Concepts are introduced using clear step-by-step explanations suitable for readers with only a basic knowledge of differential equations and probabilities, and are richly illustrated by figures and worked-out examples. End-of-chapter summaries and classroom-tested exercises make the book ideal for courses or for self-study. The authors also give pointers to the literature and an extensive bibliography, which will prove invaluable to readers interested in further study.},

  title       = {Structural constraints on the emergence of oscillations in multi-population neural networks},
  abstract    = {Oscillations arise in many real-world systems and are associated with both functional and dysfunctional states. Whether a network can oscillate can be estimated if we know the strength of interaction between nodes. But in real-world networks (in particular in biological networks) it is usually not possible to know the exact connection weights. Therefore, it is important to determine the structural properties of a network necessary to generate oscillations. Here, we provide a proof that uses dynamical system theory to prove that an odd number of inhibitory nodes and strong enough connections are necessary to generate oscillations in a single cycle threshold-linear network. We illustrate these analytical results in a biologically plausible network with either firing-rate based or spiking neurons. Our work provides structural properties necessary to generate oscillations in a network. We use this knowledge to reconcile recent experimental findings about oscillations in basal ganglia with classical findings.},
