    abstract = { Experimental demonstration of the general law of the interference of light. In making some experiments on the fringes of colours accompanying shadows, I have found so simple and so demonstrative a proof of the general law of the interference of two portions of light, which I have already endeavoured to establish, that I think it right to lay before the Royal Society, a short statement of the facts which appear to me so decisive. }
