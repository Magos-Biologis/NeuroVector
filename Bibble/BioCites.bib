For a certain range of conductances, the model generates chaotic action potentials, and the intracellular calcium concentration also varies chaotically. The chaos was characterized by constructing phase portraits and one-variable maps using the membrane potentials and calcium concentrations. This is the first, simple, biophysically realistic model for excitable cells that shows endogenous chaos.},

  abstract     = {Reliable activation of inhibitory pathways is essential for maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition during cortical activity. Little is known, however, about the activation of these pathways at the level of the local neocortical microcircuit. We report a disynaptic inhibitory pathway among neocortical pyramidal cells (PCs). Inhibitory responses were evoked in layer 5~{PC}s following stimulation of individual neighboring PCs with trains of action potentials. The probability for inhibition between. PCs was more than twice that of direct excitation, and inhibitory responses increased as a function of rate and duration of presynaptic discharge. Simultaneous somatic and dendritic recordings indicated that inhibition originated from PC apical and tuft dendrites. Multineuron whole-cell recordings from PCs and interneurons combined with morphological reconstructions revealed the mediating interneurons as Martinotti cells. Martinotti cells received facilitating synapses from PCs and formed reliable inhibitory synapses onto dendrites of neighboring PCs. We describe this feedback pathway and propose it as a central mechanism for regulation of cortical activity. \textcopyright 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

It is a barrier between the intracellular and extracellular environments. The general structure of the neuronal plasma membrane is similar to that of other plasma membranes. It is made up of proteins inserted in a lipid bilayer, forming as a whole a 'fluid mosaic'. However, insofar as there are functions that are exclusively neuronal, the neuronal membrane differs from other plasma membranes by the nature, density and spatial distribution of the proteins of which it is composed. The presence of a large diversity of transmembrane proteins called ionic channels (or simply 'channels') characterizes the neuronal plasma membrane. They allow the passive movement of ions across membranes and thus electrical signaling in the nervous system.},

  abstract     = {The ionic basis for nerve excitation was first elucidated in the squid giant axon by Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) using the voltage clamp technique. They made the key observation that two separate voltage-dependent currents underlie the action potential: an early transient inward Na\textsuperscript{+} current which depolarizes the membrane, and a delayed outward K\textsuperscript{+} current largely responsible for repolarization. This led to a series of experiments that resulted in a quantitative description of impulse generation and propagation in the squid axon. Nearly 30 years later, Sakmann and Neher, using the patch clamp technique, recorded the activity of the voltage-gated Na\textsuperscript{+} and K\textsuperscript{+} channels responsible for action potential initiation and propagation. Taking history backwards, action potentials will be explained from the single channel level to the membrane level.},

  abstract        = {Nerve cells (i.e., neurons) communicate via a combination of electrical and chemical signals. Within the neuron, electrical signals driven by charged particles allow rapid conduction from one end of the cell to the other. Communication between neurons occurs at tiny gaps called synapses, where specialized parts of the two cells (i.e., the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons) come within nanometers of one another to allow for chemical transmission. The presynaptic neuron releases a chemical (i.e., a neurotransmitter) that is received by the postsynaptic neuron's specialized proteins called neurotransmitter receptors. The neurotransmitter molecules bind to the receptor proteins and alter postsynaptic neuronal function. Two types of neurotransmitter receptors exist-ligand-gated ion channels, which permit rapid ion flow directly across the outer cell membrane, and G-protein-coupled receptors, which set into motion chemical signaling events within the cell. Hundreds of molecules are known to act as neurotransmitters in the brain. Neuronal development and function also are affected by peptides known as neurotrophins and by steroid hormones. This article reviews the chemical nature, neuronal actions, receptor subtypes, and therapeutic roles of several transmitters, neurotrophins, and hormones. It focuses on neurotransmitters with important roles in acute and chronic alcohol effects on the brain, such as those that contribute to intoxication, tolerance, dependence, and neurotoxicity, as well as maintained alcohol drinking and addiction.},

Several characteristics distinguish these two mechanisms of communication, such as speed, reliability and the fact that electrical synapses are, potentially, bidirectional. Given these properties, electrical synapses can subserve, in addition to synchrony, three main interrelated network functions: signal amplification, noise reduction and/or coincidence detection. Specific network motifs in sensory and motor systems of invertebrates and vertebrates illustrate how signal transmission through electrical junctions contributes to a complex processing of information.},

The term synapse was introduced by Sherrington (1897) to describe these zones of contact between neurons, specialized in the transmission of information. In fact, the term 'synapse' is not used exclusively to describe connections between neurons (interneuronal connections) but also those between neurons and effector cells such as muscular and glandular cells (neuroeffector synapses) and those between receptive cells and neurons. These contacts are the points where the information is transmitted from one cell to the other: synaptic transmission. According to morphological and functional criteria, there are various types of synapses, including chemical, electrical and mixed types.},

  abstract     = {The nervous system processes sensory information and controls behavior by performing an enormous number of computations. These computations occur both within cells and between cells, but it is intercellular information processing, involving complex neural networks, that provides the nervous system with its remarkable functional capacity. The principal cells involved in information processing are neurons, of which there are hundreds, if not thousands of individual cell types based on morphology, location, connectivity and chemistry [1]. In addition to neurons, the other major kind of cell in the nervous system is the glia, which play critical support roles, but which are increasingly seen to function in some aspects of information processing. To provide some idea of the magnitude of the information processing capacity of the human brain, its 10 11 neurons make, on average, about 1000 connections or synapses, at which communication occurs with other neurons. The range of synapses per cell is very large; the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum may receive 100,000 contacts from input cells. Overall the human brain may contain between 10 14 and 10 15~{s}ynaptic connections. The diverse chemical substances that carry information between neurons are called neurotransmitters. Otto Loewi discovered the first neurotransmitter in 1926 when he demonstrated that acetylcholine carried a chemical signal from the vagus nerve to the heart that slowed the cardiac rhythm. Since that time, more than one hundred substances and a far larger number of receptors have been implicated in synaptic transmission (Box 1). Because of the remarkably diverse effects of neurotransmitter-mediated signaling at the receptor and post-receptor levels, the number of neurotransmitters, as large as it is, vastly understates the complexity of signaling in the brain. In the nervous systems of higher animals, only a small fraction of neurons are directly involved in transducing sensory information or controlling output cells, such as endocrine, smooth muscle or striated muscle cells. The vast majority form what Nauta [2] called the great intermediate net, which underlies the extraordinary computational power of the brain. The complex set of neuronal networks interposed between input and output neurons form the basis, inter alia, for learning complex motor sequences, for thought, emotion, for 'top down' behavioral control and, in humans, for such functions as language, writing poetry and planning wars. In addition to performing present-oriented computations, the nervous system is plastic; it alters itself (forms memories) as it processes information, so that it can respond more adaptively in the future. The subtlety and complexity of the brain's outputs, along with its ability to change in response to new information, is supported by a rich set of mechanisms for cell-cell communication involving at an anatomical level, intricate but plastic local connections, larger scale neural circuits and overlying global regulatory systems; and at the chemical level, a large number of neurotransmitters with highly diverse mechanisms for decoding their informational content. Because neurotransmitters play such a central role in brain function, neurotransmitter receptors and other proteins involved in neurotransmitter synthesis and inactivation are critical targets for the development of therapeutic drugs meant to treat psychiatric and neurologic disorders, pain, and a host of other ills [3]. Moreover, natural substances, such as cocaine, opiates, nicotine, ethyl alcohol and LSD, that can mimic or interfere with actions of neurotransmitters, exert potent effects on human behavior [3]. Neurons are specialized to receive, process, and transmit information (Figure 1). As a first approximation, information is represented electrically within neurons and chemically (by neurotransmitters) between neurons. Once released, neurotransmitters diffuse across the synapse to bind to postsynaptic receptors.

When these afferents are activated, if their combined effect is depolarizing enough, they trigger the firing of sodium action potentials in the postsynaptic neuron. Classically, it is accepted that these action potentials are generated at a central point in the neuron, at the level of the initial segment of the axon (action potential generating zone). The action potential propagates back to the soma and forward to the axon and axon terminals. Action potentials are the response of the postsynaptic neuron. The events that lead to a postsynaptic response can be separated into several stages.
