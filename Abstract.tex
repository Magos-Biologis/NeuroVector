Neurons are fundamental to most animal life as we know it today. Therefore, a lot of studies have been performed in order to try to figure out how they work. One of these models is the Hodgkin-Huxley model of a squid giant axon. The Hodgkin-Huxley model has become an important part of neuron modeling. It was first composed in 1952 and has since been derived into several new models. The goal of this project was to model a network of three Hodgkin-Huxley neurons, with the research question ``To what extent is it possible to develop a model for inter-neuronal signal propagation and interaction, based on the Hodgkin-Huxley model of electrical activity of a neuron?'' The research question was answered with the use of mathematical coupling and using Python as a tool to visualize this model. The authors of this paper were able to couple the three neurons successfully, however, there are, of course, limitations to the model. The main limitation is that the model included some necessary simplifications of what is going on in a neuron. Therefore, the model does not completely accurately represent reality.
