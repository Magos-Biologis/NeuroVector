Due to the very ambitious goals of this project, the journey is not yet complete. The future holds promising opportunities for further exploration and validation. Most importantly, other researchers can build on this project in order to craft new, more advanced models that focus on even more neuron interactions like this project originally intended to. With more time and resources on your hands, we could explore the complexities behind a motif of five neurons, which could also be extended to an even larger~number.

Another interesting topic that this project did not manage to cover besides its high interest is the way seizures function. This subject was discussed a lot during the formation of the group and played a crucial role in finding the right direction of the research question. Unfortunately, because of the countless opportunities and roads that were suggested, this direction was unrealistic to also follow.
