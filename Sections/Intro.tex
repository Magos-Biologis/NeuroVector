%This is alledgedly an introduction \cite{doi:10.1098/rstl.1804.0001}


Neurons serve as the foundational elements shaping the intricate architecture of the brain, and nervous systems. To explore the behavior of the brain, numerous neural designs have been suggested and examined, aiming to delineate the dynamic patterns of electrical activity \cite{njitacke2020hidden}.




\begin{enumerate}
    \item Neurons exist
    \item Neurons  create networks
    \item Networks have interesting dynamics on the macro scale
    \item Inter-neuron dynamics should still be goverened by HH
    \item We want to focus on modeling the dynamics of neuron to neuron connections
\end{enumerate}
