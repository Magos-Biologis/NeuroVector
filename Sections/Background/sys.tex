The attempt to find an equation which can accurately describe the behavior of a chosen system is one of the most fundemental aspects of mathematics. 

A dynamic model is series of mathematical equations capable of replicating the behavior of a system. A role of these models, known as dynamic systems, is to bring light in the gaps of understanding and explain the underlying mechanisms behind some function.
