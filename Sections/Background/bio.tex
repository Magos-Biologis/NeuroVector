\section{The Neuron}

\input{Pictures/Anakin/Dendrite}

The human body is composed of a vast number of cells and complex interactions, how could anyone ever expect these meaty lumps we call `people' to coordinate properly without an equally complex system for the transfer of information. 
Neurons are information highways made manifest in multi-cellular organisms. 
There exists many distinct types of neuron, however, the underlying mechanisms of function stay the same.


\section{Defining Cellular Structures}

The neuron has a number of important features that have led to the properties of the Hodgkin-Huxley model;
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The soma} is the body of the neuron. As it contains the nucleus, most protein synthesis occurs here. The nucleus can range from 3 to 18 micrometers in diameter.
    \item \textbf{The dendrites} of a neuron are cellular extensions with many branches. This overall shape and structure are referred to metaphorically as a dendritic tree. This is where the majority of input to the neuron occurs via the dendritic spine.
    \item \textbf{The axon} is a finer, cable-like projection that can extend tens, hundreds, or even tens of thousands of times the diameter of the soma in length. The axon primarily carries nerve signals away from the soma and carries some types of information back to it. Most neurons have only one axon, but this axon will be able to undergo significant branching, enabling communication with many target cells. The part of the axon where it emerges from the soma is called the axon hillock. The axon hillock has the greatest density of voltage-dependent sodium channels. This makes it the most easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon. 
    \item \textbf{The axon terminal} is found at the end of the axon farthest from the soma and contains synapses. 
\end{enumerate}


\section{Lipid Bilayer}
A lipid bilayer is a powerful electrical insulator, but in neurons, many of the protein structures embedded in the membrane are electrically active \cite{}. 
These include ion channels that permit electrically charged ions to flow across the membrane and ion pumps that chemically transport ions from one side of the membrane to the other. Most ion channels are permeable only to specific types of ions.
Some ion channels are voltage gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by altering the voltage difference across the membrane. 
Others are chemically gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by interactions with chemicals that diffuse through the extracellular fluid.

The ion materials include sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium \footnotemark. \footnotetext{\(Na^+, \, K^+, \, Cl^-, \text{ and } Ca^{2+}\)} 
The interactions between ion channels and ion pumps produce a voltage difference across the membrane, typically a bit less than 1/10 of a volt at baseline. 
This voltage has two functions: first, it provides a power source for an assortment of voltage-dependent protein machinery that is embedded in the membrane; second, it provides a basis for electrical signal transmission between different parts of the membrane.
