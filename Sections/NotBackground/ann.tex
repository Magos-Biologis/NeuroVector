\chapter{Artificial neural networks}

`\textit{Artificial neural networks}' (ANN) are a mathematical analogy of the biological neuronal networks found in the brain \cite{EEGbook}. Each functional unit within the ANN needs to mimic the behavior of a neuronal cell found in the brain, connected together as a series of nodes, allowing for an approximate mathematical construct of real neuronal networks\footnote{Neuronal networks are not the same as a neural network, a term co-opted by the computer scientists to describe black box code.}.

An artificial network will contain \(k = 1, 2, \cdots , K\) interconnected nodes. Each node\footnotemark comprises of three base elements:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Inputs:} a set of \(N\) inputs to the node, \(s_{k1}, s_{k1}, \cdots, s_{kN}\), each with its own weight, \(h_{k1}, h_{k1}, \cdots, h_{kN}\), that represents how much influence a given input has on the node. Analogous to the inputs a biological neuron recieves along its dendrites.
    \item \textbf{The Integrator:} the mechanism by which all the inputs are summed together. Analogous to how membrane potential is summed in the soma of a biological neuron. 
    \begin{equation}
        v_k = \sum_{n=1}^N h_{kn}s_{kn} + b_k
    \end{equation}
    \(v_k\) being the summed voltage offset by \(b_k\), also known as the `\textit{integrate and fire}' model \cref{eq:IFperf}. 
    \item \textbf{The Activation Function:} a function \(\psi\br{ \cdot }\) which maps \(v_k\) to the output of the node such that \(y_k = \psi\br{v_k}\). Analogous to the firing of an action potential in a neuron.
\end{enumerate}
